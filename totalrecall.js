// Total Recall JavaScript

//1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
let color = "red"

//2. How do we change the value of a variable?
color = "blue"
//3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
let newColor = color

//4. Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
//Declare: we create a variable by using the word "let or const"
//Assign: giving value after declaring a variable
//Define: giving a variable its initial data type

//5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
//What is: Pseudocoding is a way to write a description of a computer program or  algorithm in plain english
//Why: We should use to simplify and planning the program in small logical steps. 


//6. What percentage of time should be spent
//thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
//A reasonable amount spent in planning and solving the problem is 50-70%
//and for coding it takes about 50-30%

//=============================================================================
// Section B string
//===============================================================================

//1. Create a variable called firstVariable
let firstVariable

//2. Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
firstVariable = "Hello World"

//3. Change the value of this variable to some number
firstVariable = 12

//4. Store the value of firstVariable in a new variable called second Variable
let secondVariable = firstVariable

//5. Change the value of secondVariableto any string.
secondVariable = "I am happy"

//6. What is the value of firstVariable?
//it must print 12
console.log(firstVariable)

//7. Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string.
//Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " 
//and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
let yourName = "Jorge"
// console.log(`my name is: ${yourName}`)
// with concatenation.
let newString = "Hello, my name is:" + " " + yourName
console.log(newString)


//====================================================
//Section C 
//====================================================
//Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks so that all log statements print truein the console.
//Answers should be all be valid JS syntax and not weird things 
//that don't make sense but happen to print trueto the console

const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';

console.log(a < b);
console.log(c > d);
console.log('Name' ==='Name');
// FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR ||
console.log(true || false);
console.log(false || false || false || false || false || true);
console.log(!false || false)
console.log(e === 'Kevin');
console.log(a + b == c); // note: a < b < c is NOT CORRECT (and is not a valid JS expression, think about using other math operations)
console.log(a * a == d); // note: the answer is a simple arithmetic equation, not something "weird"
console.log(48 == '48');


//=====================================================
// Section D the farm
//======================================================
//1. Declare a variable animal. Set it to be either "cow" or something else

let animal = "cow"

//2. Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the it is equal to cow

//3. Change your code so that if the variable animalis anything other than a cow, it will print "Hey! You're not a cow."

if(animal === "cow"){
    console.log("Mooo")
}
else{
    console.log("Hey! You are not a cow!")
}



//1. Make a variable that holds a person's age; be semantic

let age = 40;

//2.Write code that will print out "Here are the keys!", if the age is 16 years or older, or,
// if the age is younger than 16, a message should print "Sorry, you're too young."

if(age >= 16){
    console.log("Here are the keys")
}
else{
    console.log("You are too young")
};
